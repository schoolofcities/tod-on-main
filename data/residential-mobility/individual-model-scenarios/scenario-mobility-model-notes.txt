say population is 1000

I want to loop through and sample a person (an adult?) based off of odds
- based off of dictionary hard-coded of station area variables

then i will have a little dictionary entry of a person i can plug into the model

then i will have a model function, that i loop over every person

output of this function into a table of their characteristics and if yes no they move

then from this table, can summarize % of low income etc. that move




MAIN inputs:

dictionary of model

dictionary of station area metrics - pop and %s

MAIN intermediary

dictionary of person 


MAIN functions

simulate a person dictionary from a station dictionary

estimate a person's propensity to move yes/no


How to account for age/n_children?

only simulate adults?


so this mean that if we arent checking our phone/laptop prior to 730am we could lose a desk we booked?
