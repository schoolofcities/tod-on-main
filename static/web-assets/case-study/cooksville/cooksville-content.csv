A new skyline is coming to fruition, driven by transit investment and the city’s growth targets.

What happens if we continue this way? ",black,,,,contain
1,../web-assets/case-study/cooksville/crop_frame_14.png,"Local parks are small and discontinuous, and few institutional sites exist to anchor future population growth. 

New towers cluster on fragmented lots, with density pushed further up to offset costly flood mitigation measures. 

Without early investment in civic infrastructure, Cooksville risks becoming a collection of towers: dense but socially thin.  

**Is this really the best we can build?**",black,,,,contain
1,../web-assets/case-study/cooksville/crop_frame_18.png,"In this vision, density is achieved through a connected urban fabric - a mix of housing forms for how people actually live. 

Social infrastructure, from the community hub to vibrant local shops, is woven into a landscape where green corridors double as flood protection and public parks. 

By treating housing, amenities, and water as one integrated system, the plan shifts from managing constraints to building a complete, resilient, and connected Cooksville. ",black,,,,contain
