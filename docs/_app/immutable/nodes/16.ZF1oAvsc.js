As a mature residential neighbourhood, the area requires a strategic, sensitive approach to density – one that layers varied housing forms and essential community amenities within walking distance of the station while preserving the established residential core.   </p> <p>The neighbourhood’s residents are highly educated and relatively affluent. More than 60% hold a university degree, contributing to an average household income of approximately $105,000. The population is markedly youthful, with 44% of residents between the ages of 15-34, reflecting the area’s strong connection to the nearby university. </p> <p>Household composition is an almost even split between family and non-family households.  While single-detached homes account for 41% of all dwellings and visually define much of the streetscape, apartment dwellings and duplexes form the majority of the housing stock at 56%. Over half of all dwellings are rented, and 70% of households are made up of one or two people. Although driving remains the largest commuter mode at 24%, well below the national average of 80.9%.,6 this community demonstrates high transit potential: the rate of walking to work is nearly six times the city average, reflecting a preference for active, urban lifestyles. </p> <p>Despite these strengths, gaps in local services remain. CUI’s Complete Communities tool shows that the station area lacks key community-serving amenities, including community centres, libraries, and convenience stores. Access to supermarkets, pharmacies, and restaurants also lag behind projected demand, increasing pressure on the public realm to keep pace with density that has recently appeared.</p> <p>Realizing the potential of the station area will require strategic infill and carefully planned supportive infrastructure to boost ridership and foster a destination-focused, complete community.</p></div></main>');function le(p,y){O(y,!1);const a=u(),h=u();let r=q(y,"data",8),m=u(0),s=u(1),o=u("white");I(()=>{document.getElementById("top-text"),d(s,window.innerHeight);const c=()=>{d(m,window.scrollY)};return window.addEventListener("scroll",c,{passive:!0}),()=>window.removeEventListener("scroll",c)}),x(()=>(e(m),e(s)),()=>{d(a,1-Math.min(e(m)/e(s),1))}),x(()=>e(a),()=>{d(h,e(a)<.02?"none":"auto")}),P(),j();var l=Y();L(c=>{K.title="McKernan-Belgravia | School of Cities"});var n=g(l);U(n,{correctPassword:""});var i=f(n,2),t=g(i),M=g(t);S(M,{title:"McKernan-Belgravia Station",topic:"Case Study",location:"Edmonton, AB",subtitle:"How can we build infill in a diverse community with strategic infrastructure investments to support high-capacity transit ridership?",get image(){return V},imageOpacity:"1",imageAltText:"A photo",tintColour:"black",tintOpacity:"0.5",titleFontColour:"var(--brandWhite)",subtitleFontColour:"var(--brandWhite)",authorText:"Author Name, Author Name, Author Name",dateText:"~ December, 2025",get topOpacity(){return e(a)}}),v(t);var w=f(t,2);F(w,{get colour(){return e(o)}});var b=f(w,2);B(b,{get iconColour(){return e(o)},get contents(){return T(r()),A(()=>r().menuItems)}});var _=f(b,2),C=g(_);E(C,{get sections(){return T(r()),A(()=>r().animations[0].items)},header:"McKERNAN-BELGRAVIA STATION",imageAlign:"center",imageWidth:"100%",imageHeight:"100dvh",textSectionMaxWidth:"400px",textSectionAlign:"left",fadeDuration:1200,mobileTextAlign:"top",backgroundColour:"#F9F9F9",get arrowColour(){return e(o)},set arrowColour(c){d(o,c)},$$legacy:!0}),v(_),v(i),R(2),v(l),H(()=>D(t,`opacity: ${e(a)??""}; pointer-events: ${e(h)??""};`)),N(p,l),W()}export{le as component,se as universal};
