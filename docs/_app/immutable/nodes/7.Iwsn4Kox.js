It connects people to jobs, school, healthcare, grocery stores, and other essential services without the high costs of auto ownership.</p> <p>If low-income residents are displaced, especially if they are forced to move to areas with low transit accessibility, it creates barriers to access essential services and lead to social exclusion. As transit is built, keeping low-income households near these developments as well building new affordable units, helps create complete communities, reduces segregation, and ensures that the benefits of public investment in transit are shared broadly. If we fail to do this, we risk turning transit corridors into exclusive zones that serve only higher-income households, undermining goals of transportation equity and sustainability.</p> <p>On this page, we look at historical data in Canada (1990-2016) and ask two questions: <br/> 1. Have low-income residents disproportionately moved away from areas when new transit stations are built? If so, this could signal displacement pressures linked to rising housing costs or redevelopment. <br/> 2. Who has moved into new transit station areas? Are they becoming more exclusive, with fewer low-income households over time? Understanding these patterns helps us see whether transit investments are reinforcing or reducing inequality.</p> <p>To track residential mobility, we use the Longitudinal Administrative Databank (LAD)(https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=4107). This dataset is a 20% sample of Canadian tax filers assembled annually since the 1980s. It includes demographic details, low-income status, and location information (census tract and six-digit postal code) for each tax filer's home address as of December 31 for each year. By looking at whether someone's postal code has changed, and if so where, we can track whether they have moved to- or from- specific station areas.</p> <p>Using this data, our analysis looks specifically at two key metrics: <br/> 1) <strong>Out-mobility:</strong> Among low-income residents living within 800 meters of a new transit station, what percentage move away within a 10-year window (five years before and five years after the station opens)? We compare this to the overall moving rate of low-income residents across the metropolitan area (CMA) to see if transit areas experience higher turnover. <br/> 2) <strong>In-mobility:</strong> Of those who move into the new transit station area during the same period, what percentage are low-income? We also compare this to CMA mobility rates to understand whether these areas are becoming more exclusive or inclusive.</p> <p>In sum, aggregating cross</p></div> <div class="text"><p>There is a slight difference in , but overall it , h.</p> <p>The range is quite a bit larger when looking at who is moving into transit station areas. Overall, only 30% of in-movers are low-income compared to an average 37% low-income movers across CMAs in comparable time periods. This shows that transit station areas, particularly the new developments that accompany them, are more exclusive for higher-income households.</p> <p>How do these differences vary by city?
